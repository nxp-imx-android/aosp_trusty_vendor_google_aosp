[Hook Scripts]
# Run mypy on all python scripts that exist in the tree. This will only generate
# errors and warnings related to the CLs being uploaded as long as all other
# scripts are already linter clean. However, mypy warnings will be repeated when
# uploading multiple CLs. This is a known limitation which also affects pylint.
# https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/repohooks/#todo_limitations.
#
# We cannot use `find ... -execdir mypy {} +` directly since find does not
# propagate status codes from the -execXXX family of arguments so we use xargs
# instead. We also cannot use pipes directly in a hook script so we wrap
# everything inside a shell command (`sh -c`).
mypy = sh -c "find . -name '*.py' | xargs -I{} mypy {}"
